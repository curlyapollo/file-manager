# file-manager
I present to you my file manager! The rules are simple: you choose which actions to perform with the file system. 
You will be offered 10 options: 
1. view the list of computer disks and select a disk;
2. move to another directory (select folder);
3. view the list of files in the directory;
4. output the contents of the text file to the console in
the encoding chosen by the user (at least three options are provided, including UTF-8);
5. copying a file;
6. moving the file to the directory selected by the user;
7. deleting a file;
8. creating a simple text file in the encoding chosen by the user (including UTF-8);
9. concatenation of the contents of two or more text files and output of the result to the console in UTF-8 encoding;
10. output of all files in the current directory (or all its subdirectories) by the specified mask.

To select an option, you need to enter its number and press Enter. 
Also in my program there is such a thing as 'default path'. This is the path you got into through the first two functions.
Then you follow the instructions from each specific option.
After each completed action, you will be asked to either continue by typing 'yes',
or finish the job by typing something else.
